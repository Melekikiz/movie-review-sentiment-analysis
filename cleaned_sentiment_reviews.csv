Shawshank Redeems Hollywood
the shawshank redemption
IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time
The Shawshank Redemption
Stephen King's best adapted movie
"Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!"
Two movies in one
"Simply known as ""The Movie"""
My favorite movie of all time.
Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.
The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.
All-time prison film classic
"Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . ."
Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction
"""I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning""."
A Timeless Tale of Hope and Resilience
Finding Beauty in the Shadows
The best story ever told on film
The Greatest Movie of all Time
Hope is everything
"The UNIVERSALITY OF SHAWSHANK: ANDY DESFRENE AS ""EVERYMAN"""
From my favorite movies..
Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film
A movie revolution upon all others
A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.
Undeservedly top 1
"Sometimes, we all just don't agree."
Greatest movie of all time!
never give up hope
One of the most powerful movies I've ever watched
"""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook"""

One of my favourites...
Best movie of all time!
This is a wonderful movie!!!!
its an excellent piece of art
"Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy."

Powerful Masterpiece
"An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective.."
My own personal view
Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.
Overrated sappy drama
absurd and so predictable
An extraordinary and unforgettable film about a bank veep who is convicted of murders and sentenced to the toughest prison
Good for the spirit
I didn't think films could be this good....
Simply Wonderful
